# My-Top-10-movies
Have you ever seen websites that compile lists of their top favourite movies of all time?

e.g.

British Film Institute: https://www2.bfi.org.uk/greatest-films-all-time

Empire: https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/best-movies-2/

New York Times: https://www.imdb.com/list/ls058705802/

In fact, there are companies who have built their entire business around helping people build lists of their favourite things.

e.g.  https://www.listchallenges.com/

We've build a website just like that using Flask/WTForms/SQLite/SQLAlchemy and more.
It will allow us to create a beautiful website that lists our top 10 films of all time. 
As we watch more movies, we can always update our list and keep track of which movies to recommend people.
